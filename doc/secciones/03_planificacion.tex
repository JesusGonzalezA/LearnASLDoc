\chapter{Planification}

\section{Methodology}
In the degree, we usually use a waterfall model (see figure \ref{fig:planification_waterfall_model}) to develop software. For small projects and use cases this methodology
works fine, but in bigger projects it carries a lot of issues (late detection of errors related to analysis and design, testing late and difficulty to change or add new requisites).
In addition, due to my limited experience I think an agile methodology would fit to a development
process that overlaps with learning phases. \\

        \caption{Waterfall Model. \cite{Waterfall}}
        \label{fig:planification_waterfall_model}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Although the Scrum model (see figure \ref{fig:planification_scrum_model}) uses fixed time sprints, I decided to use sprints of variable duration as 
the time that could be devoted to the project was not constant. Each sprint was designed in terms of 
the value added.

\begin{figure}[H]

        \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{assets/scrum.png}
        \caption{Scrum Model. \cite{Scrum}}
        \label{fig:planification_scrum_model}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Firstly, I identified all the tasks that I would have to complete to develop the application and the thesis itself. These tasks are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Literature review
    \item Backend
    \item Frontend
    \item Deep Learning service
    \item Documentation
    \item Design
\end{itemize}

Each sprint contained subtasks of the previous list and where associated with a milestone.
Each milestone added value with respect to the previous one and was validated by my advisor.

\section{Project schedule}

In order to create my project schedule, I used Notion \cite{Notion}. Notion's schedule information can be checked \href{https://cyclic-chiller-238.notion.site/LearnASL-60bb8f91ed8f4ccfa90f98ee2306403d}{here}. \\

\subsection{Re-scheduling the project}
I changed the order of the milestones (see table \ref{table:planification_real_v1}). I decided to develop the backend of the application first, instead of the frontend or implementing them in the same time. \\

This decision was made because focusing on the same technology would allow me to go faster because I was learning ASP.NET core in my
university, so I could ask my teachers for help and it also helped me to study. \\

    }
\caption{Project schedule - v1}
\label{table:planification_real_v1}
\end{table}

The next modification (see table \ref{table:planification_real_v2}) was made because I did not take into account the task of documenting what I was implementing, and I had to subdivide the \textit{Frontend} task as well. \\

Also, I underestimated the time required to do unit tests as I had to learn about additional aspects by myself. \\

The next modification (see table \ref{table:planification_real_v3}) was made because I overestimed the time required to learn the unit testing framework. This 
allowed me to have some extra days devoted to rest and design the application. \\

The last re-scheduling (see table \ref{table:planification_real_v4}) was done because the frontend task took more than expected. I increased the priority of the deep learning model integration task. \\

In addition, I added some tasks, such as creating this document itself or improving the AI (Artificial Intelligence) service. \\

Real TODO
The following table shows the final task list of the project and the duration of each one.

\section{Development monitoring}
The communication with my advisor was both asynchronous (email) and synchronous (videoconferencing).
When we needed to have a conversation or show a part of the application we scheduled meetings using Google Meet \cite{GMeet}.
The meeting list is shown on table \ref{table:planification_sync}.
