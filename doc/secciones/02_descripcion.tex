\chapter{Problem description}

There is a big gap between deaf and dumb communities and the rest of society. Sign languages are vital for deaf and dumb people to communicate, and this gap is even bigger because most of people does not know how to sign. \\

In addition, old studies use expensive hardware, which make the learning process of sign language even less accesible. \\ 

In order to lessen this gap, an application is planned to be developed, using just integrated hardware of user's devices. Therefore, people will have a new resource to learn how to sign and validate if they are performing correctly.

\section{Description of the application}
The application, \textbf{Learn ASL}, is planned to be a web application, as it should be accesible to every device and every operative system.
The main objective of the application is to allow users to learn words in sign language and verify if they are signing correctly. \\

This way, the user would be able to do tests. In these tests the user would be asked:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{A word:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The user would select the video that matches.
            \item The user would sign the word and the application would verify if the signed word in the video matches.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{A video:} The user would select the word that matches.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requisites of the application}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Internet connection.
    \item Integrated camera or external camera.
    \item An email account is required.
\end{itemize}
