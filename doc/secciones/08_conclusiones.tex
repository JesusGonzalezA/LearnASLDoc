\chapter{Conclusions and future work}



Not every development process helps the developer to improve, as this is something that the worker should have as own objective from the very first moment. \\

The development process of this work was not ideal, as I could have used other tools, I used \textit{Beta} versions of applications and I chose a theme in which I had no experience. \\
 
The idea of this work was to help people, as it is the main objective of its development. Among this people I am included, as I chose tools that were actually used in the sector and to use it as my portfolio. I started trying to use \textit{TDD}, but I was not familiar with testing. Therefore, I tested after implementing the application. Also, planification and designing were not followed as the designing and planification was made by a person with no experience. It did not make sense to do it very conscious, so I was very flexible with that. I depended on the classes I had on the university to learn the tools, so I had to change the project planification as the planification in the subject changed. \\

For future projects, I would ask an expert in the field to planificate and I would try to design more. In this case, I used migrations and other strategies as I was aware of my lack of experience. \\

This work aims to test a deep learning model to translate from videos to text in an actual environment. The fact is that I achieved to develop an application that can really be used to help people learn to sign. The model is not accurate enough to have a good user experience but the work shows the \textbf{lack of good datasets}, the \textbf{bad documentation} of existing models and \textbf{the lack of projects that use existing models for real scenarios}. The scientific production in software development is limited to create models, create datasets or applications. Integration of them all is what matters. \\

The \textit{TODO} of this application are remarkable and visible as you use the application. Improving UX, UI, OAuth, Performance, etc. Nevertheless, from this project there could be some others interested on this field. This is just the start to think on the integration of deaf communities in society. \\

If a very good model was made open source, some other projects such as a videocall application for signing language, this application and some others ideas would come to reality.
