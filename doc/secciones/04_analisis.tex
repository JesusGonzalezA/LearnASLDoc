\section{Tool's selection}

The main reason why I chosed these technologies is because they would allow me to develop the application and I've already some experience with them. \\ 

This way, I could minimize the risk of the development process and get the first MVP as soon as possible. \\

In addition, all technologies are standards in industry and learning more about them will allow me to fit better in the market. \\ 

Although I have more experience using other technologies, as they are requirements in the degree, I beleive this stack fits better my neccessities and are better adapted to this type of development.
